# Caress, a small lua/LÃ–VE framework.

This project is a framework that I created for use on my efforts as a game
developer. It is far from ready for general use, but I thought it would be nice
to share it.

## Features

Currently it has:

 * Some useful data structures,
 * A class system and some basic classes
 * Collision detection/handling for 2D games
 * A module for async code that gives this framework it's name
